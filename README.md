**Semiconductor Pairs Trading Research Pipeline**

This project is a Python-based research pipeline for exploring a simple pairs trading strategy in the semiconductor sector. It downloads historical market data, analyzes relationships between stocks, builds a rule-based mean-reversion strategy, and evaluates its performance on a separate out-of-sample trading period.

The goal of the project is not to claim a profitable production strategy, but to demonstrate the ability to design and implement a complete quantitative research workflow. The repository covers data collection, exploratory analysis, strategy construction, and backtest evaluation using real equity price data.

The strategy focuses on highly liquid, well-observed semiconductor stocks. As expected, results are modest and inconsistent out of sample. This is an important part of the project: simple models are unlikely to produce strong predictive power in efficient markets, especially on widely followed stocks. The value of the project is therefore in the reproducible coding pipeline, the structure of the analysis, and the critical evaluation of model limitations.

Project Workflow
Download and clean historical semiconductor stock data.
Split the data into an analysis period and a trading period.
Explore correlations and candidate stock pairs.
Build a simple threshold-based pairs trading model.
Evaluate strategy behavior across selected pairs.
Repository Structure
S1_Get_Data.ipynb – downloads and prepares market data
S2_Data_analysis.ipynb – explores correlations and candidate pairs
S3_Pairs_trading.py – implements the core trading strategy
S4_Evaluation.ipynb – evaluates the strategy on selected pairs
Data/ – processed input datasets used by the notebooks and strategy
Key Takeaway
This project shows how to build a small end-to-end quantitative research system in Python. Even though the trading results are not strong, the project demonstrates practical coding skills in data handling, analysis, model implementation, and evaluation, while also presenting the results with appropriate caution and realism.

If you want, I can turn this into a full polished README.md with sections like Installation, Usage, Results, and Future Improvements.
